This is an application of Clangâ€™s LibTooling API. See [here][1] for a tutorial and [here][2] for full documentation.

### Setup

To build, you need a copy of LLVM's (and Clang's) source tree within this directory, in a directory named `llvm-project`.
You can set that up by following [these](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html#step-0-obtaining-clang) instructions (though in this directory, rather than in `~/clang-llvm`).
Our convenience scripts also expect builds of Ninja and CMake to sit in this directory, in directories named `ninja` and `cmake`. That same guide can help you set that up.
Then:
```
cd finding-parallelizable-code-syntactically/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra
mkdir finding-parallelizable-code-syntactically
echo 'add_subdirectory(finding-parallelizable-code-syntactically)' >> CMakeLists.txt
```
Create in that new directory a file named `CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:
```
set(LLVM_LINK_COMPONENTS support)

file(GLOB reduction-detector-SRC
    "*.cpp"
)
 
add_clang_executable(reduction-detector
     ${reduction-detector-SRC}
)
target_link_libraries(reduction-detector
  PRIVATE
  clangTooling
  clangBasic
  clangASTMatchers
)
```
Then, execute our script `set-up-build.sh` to generate the necessary Ninja files with CMake. Then, `build.sh` can be used to copy the tool's source files into LLVM's tree and build it.
