Unlikely reduction loop at /home/joaolrezende/Desktop/pesquisa/reduction-detector/test cases/non-reduction loops/artificial non-examples.c:16:3:
for (size_t i = 0; i < array_size; ++i) {
    result += array[i];
}
Its iteration variable is i.
Arrays subscripted by i: array (1 accesses).
Likely accumulators:

    result was detected as a possible accumulator, but not as a likely one (score: 5). But it is a trivial accumulator.
    Its base is result, which was declared 1 lines above the loop.
    Its name doesn't have any of the common accumulator-name substrings.
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        result += array[i]
    1 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 0 other in-loop references to result outside of those possible accumulating assignments.
    The value acquired by result in the loop seems to be abandoned after the loop.
    The first reference to result after the loop is in the expression "result = 0".
    It is a local variable.
    It does not seem to be a dereference of an inconstant pointer.

    Its name doesn't have any of the common accumulator-name substrings.
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:

    The value acquired by walker->a_number in the loop does not seem to be abandoned after the loop.
    It is never referenced after the loop.
    It is not a local variable.
    It seems to be a dereference of an inconstant pointer.

0 out of 3 loops detected as likely reduction loops. 1 of them are trivial reductions.
    0 out of 2 for loops.
    0 out of 1 while loops.
    0 out of 0 do-while loops.
