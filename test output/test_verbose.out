Its iteration variable is i.
Arrays subscripted by i: array (1 accesses).
Likely accumulators: sum

    sum was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 11). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    Its base is sum, which was declared 1 lines above the loop.
    Its name has the substring "sum".
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
    0 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 1 other in-loop references to sum outside of those possible accumulating assignments.

Likely accumulators: *accumulator

    *accumulator was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 14). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    Its base is accumulator, which was declared 1 lines above the loop.
    Its name has the substring "acc".
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        *accumulator += array[i]
    1 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
