Its iteration variable is i.
Arrays subscripted by i: arr (1 accesses).
Likely accumulators: accumulators[0]

    accumulators[0] was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 14). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    It was declared -1 lines above the loop.
    Its name has the substring "acc".
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        accumulators[0] = arr[i] + accumulators[0]
    1 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 1 other in-loop references to accumulators[0] outside of those possible accumulating assignments.

        accumulators[1] += arr[i];
        i += 1;
    }
I couldn't determine its iteration variable.
Likely accumulators: i accumulators[1]

    i was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 8). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    It was declared -1 lines above the loop.
    Its name doesn't have any of the common accumulator-name substrings.
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        i += 1
    0 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 2 other in-loop references to i outside of those possible accumulating assignments.

    accumulators[1] was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 15). But it is a trivial accumulator.
    It was declared -1 lines above the loop.
    Its name has the substring "acc".
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        accumulators[1] += arr[i]
    0 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 0 other in-loop references to accumulators[1] outside of those possible accumulating assignments.

I couldn't determine its iteration variable.
Likely accumulators: i accumulators[2]

    i was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 8). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    It was declared -1 lines above the loop.
    Its name doesn't have any of the common accumulator-name substrings.
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:

    accumulators[2] was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 15). But it is a trivial accumulator.
    It was declared -1 lines above the loop.
    Its name has the substring "acc".
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        accumulators[2] += arr[i]
    0 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 0 other in-loop references to accumulators[2] outside of those possible accumulating assignments.

3 out of 3 loops detected as likely reduction loops.
    1 out of 1 for loops.
    1 out of 1 while loops.
    1 out of 1 do-while loops.
