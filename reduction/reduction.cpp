/* TODO:
 * - Add a test case for a loop whose body is an expression statement,
 *   rather than a compount statement (i.e. a block).
 * - Do proper encapsulation. Make public only what needs to be public.
 *   Use getter methods.
 * - Be able to receive command-line arguments. Options like
 *   --print-unrecognized-loops (which shall default
 *   to false) and --verbose, which causes it to explain all its reasonings
 *   as
 *   precisely as possible (thus printing unrecognized loops too, of
 *   course).
 * - Get more example loops from real software systems. (See PARSEC,
 *   Cowichan.)
 * - How well do we deal with nested loops? Write some test cases for that.
 * - Be able to receive a directory as input (rather than only a single
 *   file).
 *   Then, test on larger software systems (such as Linux).
 * - Comment the code.
 * - Use deeper indentation to make reading easier. At least 4 spaces.
 * - If we plan to work with C++ too, we'll probably have to deal with other
 *   ways of iterating over an array (like range-based for loops)
 *   and with collections other than arrays.
 * - Make a basic testing framework that allows a good number of regression
 *   tests without requiring laborious output-checking effort.
 *   Each loop would go in a separate function with a unique name. Each
 *   function would be named either reduce<n> or notAReduce<n>,
 *   where <n> is an integer. The main function would then simply check
 *   whether each loop is or is not detected in accordance with
 *   the enclosing function's name. (It probably is trivial to get the name
 *   of the function in which a loop was detected.)
 *   Then, collect all tests in a single file.
 * - Should we recognize loops like the following as reductions?
 *      for (int i = 0; i < arr_length; i++)
 *          if (max < arr[i])
 *              max = arr[i];
 * - Separate the code into multiple source files.
