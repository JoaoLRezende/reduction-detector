This directory directly contains the source files of the serial C benchmarks of [NPB 3.3.1][NPB] (and, thus, doesn't include benchmarks written in Fortran − which are the majority of them − and non-serial versions of benchmarks), together with the C header files included by them, to facilitate testing.

The directory `NPB3.3.1` has the whole source code for NPB 3.3.1.
