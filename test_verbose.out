I couldn't determine its iteration variable.
Likely accumulators: ob

    ob was detected as a likely accumulator (score: 7). It is not a trivial accumulator.
    Its base is ob, which was declared 4 lines above the loop.
    Its name doesn't have any of the common accumulator-name substrings.
    It might be accumulated in the following assignments:
        ob >>= 1
    0 of those assignments involve the loop's iteration variable.
    There are 1 other in-loop references to ob outside of those possible accumulating assignments.
